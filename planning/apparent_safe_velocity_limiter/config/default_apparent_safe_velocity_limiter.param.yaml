  ros__parameters:
    min_ttc: 1.5  # [s] minimum time without collision when doing projection at each trajectory point
    distance_buffer: 1.5  # [m] extra distance to add to a projection (in addition to the vehicle overhang)
    min_adjusted_velocity: 1.5  # [m/s] minimum velocity that the module can set
    max_deceleration: 2.0  # [m/sÂ²] maximum deceleration caused by the adjusted velocity
    start_distance: 0.0  # [m] distance ahead of ego from which to start modifying the trajectory
    downsample_factor: 10  # factor by which to downsample the input trajectory for calculation

    forward_projection:
      model: bicycle  # model to use for forward projection at each trajectory point. Either "particle" or "bicycle"
      distance_method: exact  # distance calculation method. Either "exact" or "approx".
      # parameters used only with the bicycle model
      steering_offset: 0.01 # [rad] steering angle offset used to model uncertainty in the forward projection
      nb_points: 5  # number of points representing the curved projections

    obstacles:
      dynamic_source: pointcloud # source of dynamic obstacles. Must be 'pointcloud', 'occupancy_grid', or 'static_only'.
      occupancy_grid_threshold: 60 # occupancy grid values higher than this are considered to be obstacles
      dynamic_obstacles_buffer: 1.0 # [m] extra distance around dynamic obstacles used to mask the occupancy grid and avoid false obstacle detection
      dynamic_obstacles_min_vel: 0.5 # [m/s] velocity above which a dynamic obstacle is ignored by the module
      static_map_tags: # linestring tags in the lanelet maps that will be used as static obstacles
        - curbstone
        - guard_rail
        - wall
        - fence
      filter_envelope : false # whether to calculate the apparent safety envelope and use it to filter obstacles
