# Lane Change

The Lane Change module is activated when lane change is needed and can be safely executed.

## Lane Change Requirement

- During lane change request condition
  - The ego-vehicle isnâ€™t on a `preferred_lane`.
  - There is neither intersection nor crosswalk on the path of the lane change
- lane change ready condition
  - Path of the lane change does not collide with other dynamic objects (see the figure below)
  - Lane change candidate path is approved by an operator.

## Generating Lane Change Candidate Path

The lane change candidate path is divided into two phases: preparation and lane-changing. The following figure illustrates each phase of the lane change candidate path.

### Preparation phase

The preparation trajectory is the candidate path's first and the straight portion generated along the ego vehicle's current lane. The length of the preparation trajectory is computed as follows.

```C++
lane_change_prepare_distance = max(current_speed * lane_change_prepare_duration + 0.5 * deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration^2, minimum_lane_change_prepare_distance)
```

During the preparation phase, the turn signal will be activated when the remaining distance is equal to or less than `lane_change_search_distance`.

### Lane-changing phase

The lane-changing phase consist of the shifted path that moves ego from current lane to the target lane. Total distance of lane-changing phase is as follows.

```C++
lane_change_prepare_velocity = current_speed + deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration
lane_changing_distance = max(lane_change_prepare_velocity * lane_changing_duration + 0.5 * deceleration * lane_changing_duration^2, minimum_lane_change_length + backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane)
```
