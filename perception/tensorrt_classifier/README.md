# TensorRT Classification for Effcient Dynamic Batched Inference

## Purpose

This package classifies arbitary categories using TensorRT for efficient and faster inference.
Specifically, this optimzes preprocessing for efficient inference on embedded platform.
Moreover, we support dynamic batched inference in GPUs and DLAs.
